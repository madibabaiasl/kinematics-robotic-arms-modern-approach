## Why Take This Course?
Robots aren’t just sci-fi. They run warehouses, assist in surgeries, harvest crops, build houses, and even entertain. In this course, you and I will unpack the core ideas that let robots sense, plan, and act so they do useful work in the real world. We’ll keep it practical: we’ll learn a concept, then use it to move an actual robotic arm with ROS2.

By the end, you’ll be able to model a robot, describe its degrees of freedom, pose, and orientation, and compute forward, inverse, and velocity kinematics to plan motion that’s safe and purposeful. We’ll practice a full stack of robotics thinking through a mix of short theory bursts and hands-on projects.

What you’ll get out of it:

- Speak “robot”: frames, pose, orientation, and Degrees of Freedom DOFs with confidence.
- Build real intuition for kinematics (forward, inverse, velocity) and why they matter.
- Write and run ROS2 code to command a manipulator in simulation and on hardware.
- Plan, execute, and debug motions using sensors and controllers.
- Walk away with a portfolio of projects that actually move a robot.

If you’re eyeing internships in automation or research, or you just want to bring your own robotic ideas to life, this course gives you the fundamentals people expect and the confidence to use them. We’ll turn “robots” from a buzzword into a system you can describe, predict, and control.

## Course Objectives
By the end of this course, we’ll have built real, hands-on intuition for robotics, and you’ll be able to:

- Speak “robot.” Describe position, orientation, and velocity with confidence, and compute forward, inverse, and velocity kinematics to make manipulators move on purpose.
- Leverage your toolkit. Use vectors, matrices, physics, and programming to crack open practical robotics problems, not just on paper, but in code and on hardware.
- Translate concepts such as screw theory applications to various robotic systems, including soft and continuum robots.
- Build with real tools. Use Python, MATLAB, ROS2, and RoboDK to implement algorithms, write clean code, simulate, and analyze robot performance.
- Analyze how the different components of a robot, such as sensors and controllers, interact to perform coordinated tasks and respond to environmental inputs.
- Collaborate effectively in teams to design, test, and refine robotic solutions within an interdisciplinary framework.
- Document and organize work in a professional manner to develop a competitive portfolio and prepare for complex engineering projects.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, you and I will have put in enough reps that you’ll be able to:

- Define key concepts in robotics, including degrees of freedom, orientation, and pose.
- Apply forward, inverse, and velocity kinematics to model and analyze robotic manipulators.
- Design and implement robotic motion tasks using simulation and real hardware under the Robot Operating System (ROS2).
- Evaluate robotic performance using analytical and computational tools such as MATLAB, Python, and RoboDK.
- Collaborate in multidisciplinary teams to plan, execute, and document robotics projects effectively.
