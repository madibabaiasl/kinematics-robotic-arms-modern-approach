## Course Description

The Czech playwright Karel Capek is credited with coining the word "robot" in his 1920 play, R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), but the concept of robots as machines that can sense, plan, and act has been around for centuries. For example, the ancient Greeks created stories about automatons, which were self-moving machines that could perform tasks. The Unimate was the first industrial robotic arm that was used for welding, painting, and assembly. Since then, robots have been developed for a wide range of other applications, including warehousing & logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, agriculture, construction, cleaning, and even entertainment. Although the field of robotics is still under development (it is an active research area), the basic principles of robot design (modeling, perception, planning, and control) are well understood. This course introduces the foundational principles of robotics, including degrees of freedom, orientation, pose, and the kinematics of robotic manipulators (forward, inverse, and velocity kinematics). Students learn these concepts through both theoretical analysis and practical exercises using a robotic arm operated via the Robot Operating System (ROS2).


## Course Objectives
- Explain the fundamentals of robot motion, including methods to express position, orientation, and velocity, as well as forward, inverse, and velocity kinematics.
- Apply prior knowledge of vectors, matrices, physics, and programming to solve practical robotics problems.
- Translate concepts such as screw theory applications to various robotic systems, including soft and continuum robots.
- Utilize technical tools (Python, MATLAB, ROS, RoboDK, etc.) to implement algorithms, develop code, and analyze robotic performance.
- Analyze how the different components of a robot, such as sensors and controllers, interact to perform coordinated tasks and respond to environmental inputs.
- Collaborate effectively in teams to design, test, and refine robotic solutions within an interdisciplinary framework.
- Document and organize work in a professional manner to develop a competitive portfolio and prepare for complex engineering projects.
