## Why Take This Course?
Robots aren’t just sci-fi. They run warehouses, assist in surgeries, harvest crops, build houses, and even entertain. In this course, you and I will unpack the core ideas that let robots sense, plan, and act so they do useful work in the real world. We’ll keep it practical: we’ll learn a concept, then use it to move an actual robotic arm with ROS2.

By the end, you’ll be able to model a robot, describe its degrees of freedom, pose, and orientation, and compute forward, inverse, and velocity kinematics to plan motion that’s safe and purposeful. We’ll practice a full stack of robotics thinking through a mix of short theory bursts and hands-on projects.

What you’ll get out of it:

- Speak “robot”: frames, pose, orientation, and Degrees of Freedom DOFs with confidence.
- Build real intuition for screw-theory-based kinematics (forward, inverse, velocity) and why they matter.
- Write and run ROS2 code to command a manipulator in simulation and on hardware.
- Plan, execute, and debug motions using sensors and controllers.
- Walk away with a portfolio of projects that actually move a robot.

If you’re eyeing internships in automation or research, or you just want to bring your own robotic ideas to life, this course gives you the fundamentals people expect and the confidence to use them. We’ll turn “robots” from a buzzword into a system you can describe, predict, and control.

## Course Objectives
By the end of this course, we will have:

- Built intuitive and mathematical understanding of how robots represent position, orientation, and motion.
- Explored screw-theory-based formulations of forward, inverse, and velocity kinematics.
- Practiced applying mathematics, programming, and physics to analyze and control real robotic systems.
- Integrated tools such as ROS2, Python, MATLAB, and RoboDK to connect simulation with hardware.
- Investigated how sensors and control loops enable autonomous, reactive behavior.
- Worked collaboratively to design, build, and document robotic systems with professional clarity.


## Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, you will be able to:

- Define and explain key robotic concepts such as degrees of freedom, orientation, and pose.
- Compute and apply forward, inverse, and velocity kinematics using screw theory.
- Implement robotic motion tasks in simulation and hardware using ROS2, Python, and RoboDK.
- Design, document, and present a robotics project that integrates sensing, actuation, and control.
- Collaborate effectively within a multidisciplinary team to solve open-ended robotics challenges.
