## Why Take This Course?
Robots aren’t just sci-fi. They run warehouses, assist in surgeries, harvest crops, build houses, and even entertain. In this course, you and I will unpack the core ideas that let robots sense, plan, and act so they do useful work in the real world. We’ll keep it practical: we’ll learn a concept, then use it to move an actual robotic arm with ROS2.

By the end, you’ll be able to model a robot, describe its degrees of freedom, pose, and orientation, and compute forward, inverse, and velocity kinematics to plan motion that’s safe and purposeful. We’ll practice a full stack of robotics thinking through a mix of short theory bursts and hands-on projects.

What you’ll get out of it:

- Speak “robot”: frames, pose, orientation, and Degrees of Freedom DOFs with confidence.
- Build real intuition for kinematics (forward, inverse, velocity) and why they matter.
- Write and run ROS2 code to command a manipulator in simulation and on hardware.
- Plan, execute, and debug motions using sensors and controllers.
- Walk away with a portfolio of projects that actually move a robot.

## Course Objectives
- Explain the fundamentals of robot motion, including methods to express position, orientation, and velocity, as well as forward, inverse, and velocity kinematics.
- Apply prior knowledge of vectors, matrices, physics, and programming to solve practical robotics problems.
- Translate concepts such as screw theory applications to various robotic systems, including soft and continuum robots.
- Utilize technical tools (Python, MATLAB, ROS, RoboDK, etc.) to implement algorithms, develop code, and analyze robotic performance.
- Analyze how the different components of a robot, such as sensors and controllers, interact to perform coordinated tasks and respond to environmental inputs.
- Collaborate effectively in teams to design, test, and refine robotic solutions within an interdisciplinary framework.
- Document and organize work in a professional manner to develop a competitive portfolio and prepare for complex engineering projects.

## Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
- Define key concepts in robotics, including degrees of freedom, orientation, and pose.
- Apply forward, inverse, and velocity kinematics to model and analyze robotic manipulators.
- Design and implement robotic motion tasks using simulation and real hardware under the Robot Operating System (ROS2).
- Evaluate robotic performance using analytical and computational tools such as MATLAB, Python, and RoboDK.
- Collaborate in multidisciplinary teams to plan, execute, and document robotics projects effectively.
